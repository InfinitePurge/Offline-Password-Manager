5. **Copy Securely**: After generating a password, you can copy it to use immediately. Remember to clear your clipboard afterward for security.

6. **Save in WyvernGuard**: After generating a password for a new account, immediately save it in WyvernGuard's password manager to ensure you don't lose it.

### Security Considerations

- The Password Generator creates random passwords based on your settings. Each generated password is unique.
- Generated passwords are not stored unless you explicitly save them in the password manager.
- While the Password Generator creates strong passwords, the security of your accounts also depends on other factors like using unique passwords for each account and keeping your master password secure.

Remember, a strong password is your first line of defense in protecting your online accounts. Use the Password Generator to create robust, unique passwords for all your important accounts.

### Security Considerations

- Auto logout is an important security feature that helps protect your data if you forget to manually log out or leave your device unattended.
- Even with auto logout enabled, it's still good practice to manually log out when you're finished using WyvernGuard.
- The auto logout feature works in conjunction with your device's sleep or lock settings. Ensure your device is also set to lock automatically for maximum security.

### Troubleshooting

- If auto logout isn't working as expected, ensure you've saved your changes after modifying the settings.
- If you're frequently getting logged out unexpectedly, you may want to increase the auto logout time.
- Remember, the minimum auto logout time is 10 seconds. If you enter a lower value, you'll receive an error message.

Remember, while the Auto Logout feature enhances security, it's still crucial to keep your master password secure and not share it with others. Auto logout is just one layer in your overall security strategy.

- Nouns: tiger, sun, moon, star, eagle, lion, wolf, bear

You can add to these lists, edit the existing words, or delete words you don't want to use.

### Tips for Using the Username Generator

1. **Variety is Key**: Add a good variety of words to both the adjective and noun lists to ensure diverse username options.

2. **Keep it Appropriate**: Remember that these words will be used to generate usernames, so keep them appropriate for all contexts.

3. **Consider Length**: Very long words might result in usernames that are too long for some services, so consider the length of words you add.

4. **Uniqueness**: Try to include unique or uncommon words to increase the chances of generating available usernames.

5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update your word lists to keep your username options fresh and varied.

### Security Considerations

- While the Username Generator creates unique combinations, it's still possible for others to use the same words. Don't rely solely on generated usernames for security.
- Avoid using words that might reveal personal information about you.

### Using Generated Usernames

When you're creating a new account or adding a new entry in the password manager:

1. You'll see a "Generate Username" button.
2. Clicking this will create a username using your customized word lists.
3. You can generate new options until you find one you like.

Remember, a good username is memorable and unique, but your account's security primarily depends on using a strong, unique password and enabling two-factor authentication where possible.

WyvernGuard allows you to organize your passwords and secure notes into categories for easier management. Here's how to use and customize categories:

### Accessing Categories

1. From the main menu, go to "Settings".

#### Deleting a Category

1. Select the category you want to delete from the list.
2. Click the "Delete Category" button.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
4. The category will be removed, and any passwords or notes in that category will be moved to the "Other" category.

### Default Categories

WyvernGuard comes with a set of default categories:

- Work
- Personal
- Finance
- School
- Other

You can add to these, edit them, or delete them as needed.

### Using Categories

When adding or editing a password or secure note, you can assign it to a category. This helps you organize and quickly find your information later.

### Tips for Using Categories

1. **Be Consistent**: Use consistent naming conventions for your categories to make them easy to understand and use.

2. **Don't Overdo It**: While categories can be helpful, having too many can become confusing. Aim for a balance.

3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your categories and consolidate or remove any that are no longer useful.

4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose category names that clearly describe the type of information they contain.

5. **Consider Security**: Remember that category names are not encrypted, so avoid using sensitive information in category names.

### Security Considerations

- Category names are visible in the category list, so don't include sensitive information in them.
- Deleting a category doesn't delete the passwords or notes within it; they're moved to the "Other" category.
- Changes to categories are applied to all existing passwords and notes in that category.

### Troubleshooting

- If you can't delete or edit a category, make sure you've selected it in the list first.
- If you're having trouble adding a new category, check if a similar category already exists (the check is case-insensitive).
- If categories aren't saving correctly, check your permissions for writing to the application's directory.

Remember, effective use of categories can significantly improve your password management experience by helping you organize and quickly locate your stored information.




## Exporting Passwords

WyvernGuard allows you to export your passwords for backup purposes or to transfer them to another password manager. There are two export options available: CSV and Image. Here's how to use these features:

### Accessing Password Export

1. From the main menu, go to "Settings".
2. Click on the "Export Passwords" button.

### Export Options

2. You'll see a security warning. Read it carefully and confirm if you want to proceed.
3. Choose a location and filename for your CSV file.
4. The file will be created with your passwords in plain text.

**Security Considerations:**
- The CSV file is not encrypted. Anyone with access to this file can read your passwords.
- Delete the CSV file after you've used it (e.g., after importing to another service).
- Store the file securely if you're keeping it as a backup.

#### 2. Export as Image

This option hides your passwords within an image file using steganography.

**Steps:**

2. You'll see a security warning. Read it carefully and confirm if you want to proceed.
3. Select an existing image file to hide your passwords in.
4. Choose a location and filename for the output image.
5. The new image will be created with your passwords hidden inside.

**Security Considerations:**
- While the passwords are hidden, they are not encrypted within the image.
- Anyone who knows to look for hidden data in the image could potentially extract your passwords.
- Keep this image file as secure as you would keep a file with plain text passwords.

### Important Security Warnings

- Both export methods create files that are not encrypted. Treat these files with extreme caution.
- Only export your passwords when necessary, such as when switching to a new password manager.
- Always store exported files in a secure location, preferably on an encrypted drive.
- Delete exported files as soon as you no longer need them.
- Never share exported password files or upload them to any online service.

### Tips for Safe Password Exporting

1. **Use Selectively**: Only export the passwords you need, if possible.
2. **Secure Storage**: If you must keep the exported file, store it on an encrypted drive or secure cloud storage.
3. **Limited Time**: Set a reminder to delete the exported file after a short period.
4. **Avoid Public Computers**: Never perform password exports on public or shared computers.
5. **Check for Malware**: Ensure your computer is free of malware before exporting passwords.
6. **Update Passwords**: Consider updating critical passwords after performing an export, especially if you're unsure about the security of the exported file.

Remember, the security of your passwords is crucial. While exporting can be useful for backups or transfers, it also creates a potential security risk. Always handle exported password files with extreme care.

- Consider changing important passwords after importing, especially if you're unsure about the security of the import source.
- Delete the source files (CSV or image) after successful import to minimize security risks.

### Tips for Safe Password Importing

1. **Verify Source**: Ensure the CSV file or image comes from a trusted source.
2. **Check Format**: For CSV imports, make sure the file has the correct column headers ('url', 'username', 'password').
3. **Backup First**: Before importing, create a backup of your current passwords.
4. **Review After Import**: After importing, review your password list to ensure everything imported correctly.
5. **Update Critical Passwords**: Consider updating passwords for critical accounts after importing.
6. **Clean Up**: Delete the source files after successful import.

### Troubleshooting

- If the import fails, check that your CSV file is properly formatted or that your image file was created by WyvernGuard's export feature.
- For CSV imports, ensure there are no extra commas or special characters that might disrupt the file structure.
- If you're having issues with image import, try re-exporting the passwords from the original source if possible.

Remember, while importing can save time when switching password managers or restoring from a backup, it's crucial to handle the process securely to protect your sensitive information.
